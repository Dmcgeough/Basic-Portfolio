			My name is Daniel McGeough Jr. and I am a 26 year old student currently enrolled in the UNCC coding boot camp. After earning an International Studie Degree from Elon University I pursued my Masters Degree and attained a Masters of the Arts Degree in European History from University College of London. After an ultimatly unsuccesful search for a teaching job I got my first taste of coding through an online SQL class.</p>
		
			<p id = "para2">
			After dabbling in SQL I was hooked. I started searching for new ways to broaden and improve my knowledge of coding. This thirst for knowledge led me to the coding bootcamp and it is exceptional! The feeling of finding a troublesome bug or having code turn out the way you want it to as well as encountering a new problem and working your way through it is extremely fulfilling and it is something that gets quite addicting. I find my thoughts full of questions and possible fixes even when I am not coding. It is tough, there is no debating that, but it is a challenge that I feel I can overcome to break into an industry as varied and nuanced as any other.
